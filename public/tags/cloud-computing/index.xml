        <description>What are the problems with a “one size fits all” approach to relational databases? In the past, the reason why so many businesses model their data to try and fit the use cases of a relational database is that there is no other choice, so in reality many kinds of data are actually not suitable for relational model. Of course this is not to say relational databases cannot provide scalable, available and high performance service, it’s just that we now have many other database models to better suit different use cases.</description>

        <description>How does the CAP Theorem play a role in designing for the cloud? The CAP Theorem says that for a distributed system, you can only have 2 of the 3 things: Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance.
Consistency means that only have one copy of up-to-date data, and that all clients see the same data at the same time, no matter which node they connect to. For this to happen, whenever data is written to one node, it must be instantly forwarded or replicated to all the other nodes in the system before the write is deemed ‘successful.</description>

        <title>Cloud Analysis course notes - Containers</title>

        <description>What are containers? The concept of containers is similar to that of virtual machines. The differentiating factor is that VMs virtualize at the hardware level and containers virtualize at the operating system level. The containerization approach creates a more lightweight and flexible environment by allowing applications to share an operating system while maintaining their own executables, code, libraries, tools, and configuration files.
A container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package.</description>

        <description>What are the different layers of network security on AWS and what unique problems do each solve? According to the AWS security white paper, AWS has the following layers of network security:
 Secure Network Architecture  There are network devices like firewalls at the edge of the aws network to closely monitor and guard the information flow in both ways. ACLs, or Access Control List are in place to manage the traffic flow.</description>

        <description>What is IAC and what problem does it solve? IAC stands for Infrastructure as Code. is a method to provision and manage IT infrastructure through the use of source code, rather than through standard operating procedures and manual processes.
You’re basically treating your servers, databases, networks, and other infrastructure like software. And this code can help you configure and deploy these infrastructure components quickly and consistently.
IaC helps you automate the infrastructure deployment process in a repeatable, consistent manner, which has many benefits.</description>

        <description>This is the basic workflow of this blog and list of steps to continuous deployment. It is also a course note and the majority of the materials came from my professor&amp;rsquo;s post here
Set up Hugo workflow using AWS Cloud9 and Github First we are going to setup a cloud9 environment as the working directory of the whole thing.
Cloud9 provides a quick and easy linux environment/web-based editor hosted on an EC2 instance that would be automatically stopped after 30m of unuse.</description>

        <description>This is a course note and the majority of the meterials came from this qwiklab
Overview Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The Kubernetes Engine environment consists of multiple machines (specifically Google Compute Engine instances) grouped together to form a container cluster.
Kubernetes Engine clusters are powered by the Kubernetes open source cluster management system. Kubernetes provides the mechanisms through which you interact with your container cluster.</description>
