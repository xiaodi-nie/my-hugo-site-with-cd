### Ingredients
Item | Measure
   --------|------
  Milk | 100g
  Sweetener(swerve) | 15g
  Whipping Cream | 100g
  Egg yolks | 3
  Condensed Milk | 40g
  Pastry Sheet  | 1 sheet
  Small tart/muffin mold cups | 20
  (optional) berries/chocolate | some
  
### Steps

1. Preheat oven to 390F, line baking sheet with 20 tart molds(I use the tin foiled kind bought from Amazon), and de-frost the pastry sheet completely
2. Mix all ingredients together and whisk until well combined
3. Sift through the mixure until creamy and smooth. Shake a bit to release all bubbles
4. Roll the pastry sheet thin with a rolling pin, then tightly roll up the thin sheet
5. Cut the roll into 20 pieces, roll them out, then press each piece to the bottom of the tart mold. It's important to make the pieces not too thick that it's hard to cook through, and not too thin that it'll loose the layers of crunchiness.
6. Put berry/chocolate pieces into the mold if you have any, then pour in the liquid mixure. Don't fill them too full.
7. Bake for 20-25min or until the top is golden brown. Enjoy:)
